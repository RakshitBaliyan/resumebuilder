        <h2>Tips for Making a Great Resume</h2>
        <ul class="tips-list">
            <li><b>Keep it concise and relevant:</b> Your resume should be a brief overview of your most important experiences and skills, ideally no longer than one page (unless you have extensive experience). Avoid including irrelevant jobs or outdated information. Tailor your resume to each specific job application by focusing on the skills and experiences that matter most.</li>
            <li><b>Highlight achievements with measurable results:</b> Rather than listing job responsibilities, focus on quantifiable achievements. For example, instead of "Managed a team," say "Managed a team of 5, leading to a 20% increase in productivity." This showcases your impact and proves your value to potential employers.</li>
            <li><b>Use action verbs to describe responsibilities:</b> Strong action verbs like "led," "implemented," "designed," or "coordinated" make your resume more dynamic and engaging. Avoid passive language, and ensure each bullet point begins with a strong verb to highlight your active role in your accomplishments.</li>
            <li><b>Format for easy readability:</b> A clean and organized layout is essential for a professional-looking resume. Use consistent font styles, bullet points, and clear section headings. Leave enough white space to make it easier for recruiters to quickly scan your resume and find key information.</li>

    <!-- Online Interview Tips Section -->
    <section id="interview-tips">
        <h2>Tips for Acing Online Interviews</h2>
        <ul class="tips-list">
            <li><b>Test your tech before the interview:</b> Before your online interview, ensure your internet connection, microphone, and webcam are functioning properly. Log into the video conferencing platform early to test sound and video settings. This helps you avoid technical issues during the interview, which could distract both you and the interviewer.</li>
            <li><b>Dress professionally, even in a virtual setting:</b>  While you may be interviewing from home, it's essential to dress as you would for an in-person interview. Professional attire not only creates a good impression but also helps you mentally prepare and feel more confident during the interview.</li>
            <li><b>Maintain good eye contact with the camera:</b> Instead of looking at the screen or your image, focus on the camera lens to simulate direct eye contact with the interviewer. This small adjustment creates a stronger connection and shows that you’re engaged and attentive during the conversation.</li>
            <li><b>Prepare your environment for minimal distractions:</b> Choose a quiet, well-lit space for your interview. Ensure that any background noise, pets, or family members won’t interrupt the call. A neutral background or professional virtual background can also make your setting appear more polished and reduce distractions for the interviewer.</li>
